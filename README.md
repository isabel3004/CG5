Our intent was to implement a sort of spooky rainbow road.
The game starts with an animation over the track. 
Then after a transition the actual game begins. The controls are the following:
- W/S to move forward/backwards (beware of acceleration/deceleration)
- arrow L/R to turn
The objective is to pass all ports in order. If you manage to do so, the victory screen will load after a short transition.
Beware that you can fall, and that there are a couple boosters on the track.

The following shortcuts are available:
- R to restart everything from the initial animation
- space to go straight to the actual game
- tab to go to the victory screen
